#### I. The Problem
- Manual scheduling is time-consuming
- Back-and-forth emails for finding meeting times
- Calendar integration gaps

#### II. User Research
- Target users: Small business owners, consultants, informal meeting times
- Pain points identified
- Success criteria defined

#### III. Solution Design
- Why conversational AI?
- Cal.com API evaluation
- Feature prioritization (MVP vs future)

#### IV. Technical Implementation
**Product decisions made:**
- Chose GPT-4.1 for reliability over cost
- Explicit duration tracking after initial bug
- Simplified UX (removed unnecessary questions)

**Key learning: Agent asked too many questions**
- Initial: Agent asked for time of day preference
- Root cause: Over-engineered conversation flow
- Fix: Streamlined CollectPreferences task
- Result: Faster bookings, better UX

#### V. Challenges & Solutions

**Challenge 1: Wrong Event Type Selected**
```
Problem: Agent booked 15min meeting instead of 30min
Diagnosis: Duration context lost between tasks
Solution: Explicit variable tracking with clear mapping
Learning: State management critical in multi-turn conversations
```

**Challenge 2: Cancellation Not Working**
```
Problem: Platform doesn't support dynamic path parameters
Workaround: Direct users to dashboard
Learning: Not all APIs work with all platforms - understand constraints early

**Challenge 3: Google Calendar API Authentication Complexity**
Problem: Multiple authentication barriers blocked implementation (e.g. OAuth 2.0 flow setup, access tokens expiring after 1 hour, URI mismatch errors)
Solution Attempted: Multiple approaches tried (OAuth Playground with custom credentials, Adding self as test user to bypass verification, Service account exploration)
Workaround: Pivoted to Cal.com, which provided simpler API key authentication and faster time to working prototype
Learning: Authentication complexity drove technology decision

#### VI. Metrics & Impact
User testing results pending
Token cost analysis
Time saved per booking

#### VII. Future Roadmap
Cancel meetings via agent
GCal integration for greater flexibility
Scale considerations
